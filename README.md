<h2>üìä Sorting Algorithms: A Comparative Analysis</h2> 
This project focuses on a quantitative research study evaluating the performance of four sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Shell Sort**. The analysis compares their temporal and spatial efficiency, providing insights into their suitability for different scenarios, particularly in handling large datasets generated by satellite imagery. 
<h2>üéØ Project Objective</h2> 
The study aims to determine the most efficient sorting algorithm for organizing satellite images by latitude, where each image's filename corresponds to its geographic coordinates. The system processes approximately **100,000 images daily**, requiring an optimal solution for performance and scalability. 
<h2>üîç Algorithms Overview</h2> 
The project evaluates the following sorting algorithms:
Bubble Sort: Simple but inefficient for large datasets (O(n¬≤) complexity).

Quick Sort: Efficient divide-and-conquer approach (O(n log n) average case).

Selection Sort: Simple but slow (O(n¬≤) complexity).

Shell Sort: Improved insertion sort with variable gaps (O(n log n) best case).

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure</h2> 
The repository is organized as follows:
main.c: Contains the C source code for the sorting algorithms.

wildfire-tests/: Includes test datasets (wildfire-10.txt, wildfire-100.txt, etc.).

paper/: Contains documentation and reports related to the project.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

<h2>üöÄ Getting Started</h2> 
To compile and run the project on your local machine: 
<h3>Clone the repository:</h3> 
```bash git clone https://github.com/Vitor-Kenobi/aps4.git cd aps4 ``` 
<h3>Compile and execute:</h3> 
```bash gcc src/main.c -o sorting_algorithms ./sorting_algorithms ```
Ensure you have GCC installed on your system.

<h2>üìä Results and Discussion</h2> 
The study compared the algorithms' performance on semi-ordered and fully disordered datasets, testing them on machines with varying hardware specifications:
High-performance machine: AMD EPYC 7763, 16GB RAM.

Low-performance machine: Intel Xeon E5-2673, 1GB RAM.

Key findings:

Quick Sort and Shell Sort demonstrated the best performance for large datasets.

Bubble Sort and Selection Sort were significantly slower, especially with larger datasets.

Hardware resources impacted performance, with Quick Sort benefiting more from better specifications.
